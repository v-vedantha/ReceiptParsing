# Pantry

The goal of this project is to be able to
1) Parse receipts (using standard API's)
2) Use receipt information to predict what ingredients I will need, and when I will need them

Next steps:
*Add ingredients that are bough regularly to the pantry list of possible ingredients
*Remove ingredients which do not fit our suggestion model
*Use fb/inverse cooking to better adjust pantry stores depending on what you cook
